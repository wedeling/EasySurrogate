        Parameters
        ----------
        feats : Array or list of arrays
            A single feature array or a list of different feature arrays. The shape of the feature
            arrays must be (n_samples, n_points_i). Here n_samples is the number of samples and
            n_points_i is the size of a single sample of the i-th feature.
        target : Array
            The target that must be predicted by the surrogate. The shape of this array must be
            (n_samples, n_target), where n_target is the size of a single sample.
        lags : list of lists, optional
            In the case of a time-lagged surrogate, this list contains the time lags of
            each distinct feature. Each time lag is specified as a list. Example: if
            feats = [X1, X2], and lags = [[1], [1,2]], then X_1 will get lagged by one time step
            and X_2 will get lagged by two time steps. The default is None.
        local : boolean, optional
            If false, each feature sample of n_points_i will be used as input. If true, the
            surrogate will be applied locally, meaning that n_points_i separate scalar input
            features will be extracted from each feature sample. If true, the size of all
            features and target must be the same: n_points_i (for all i) = n_target = a fixed
            number. The default is False.
        test_frac : float, optional
            The final fraction of the training data that is withheld from training.
            The default is 0.0, and it must be in [0.0, 1.0].
        valid_frac : float, optional
            The fraction of the testing data that is withheld to be considered for validation.
            The default is 0.0, and it must be in [0.0, 1.0].
        train_first: boolean, if True then use first (1.0-test_frac) samples for training,
            otherwise chose training sample at random
        index: list of inidices of data samples to be chosen for training set
